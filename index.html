        <!-- About
        –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––– -->
        <h2 id="about" class="noPaddingTop">About</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Welcome! My name is Joost Ouwerling, born and raised in The Netherlands. I have studied at the University of Groningen, where I completed two Bachelors of Science, in Computing Science and Applied Physics. As an extracurricular activity, I attended Stanford University's Summer Session in 2015, where I took classes on computational physics, data mining & analysis and entrepreneurship. I plan to start a Master of Science in Computing Science in September, 2017.  
        </p>
        <p>I am currently interning at Google, where I work on image decoders in the Chrome team. Previously, I was a teaching assistant for the courses Physics Laboratory 1 and Advanced Algorithms and Data Structures, in addition to being a mentor for freshman Applied Physics students. Next to my studies, I co-run a full service internetbureau, developing websites and online marketing strategies for small businesses.</p> 
        <p>
          My career as a programmer started in 2007 when I built MedievalGuild, an online text-based game, which quickly grew into a small business. Two years later I built another online game, exploited by BoGames, together with a business-oriented friend. This turned out to be of a larger scale and we attracted many players, which resulted in some very interesting technical and business challenges, and a profitable company.
        </p>

          BoGames exploited Mafiaroots, an online text-based mafia game. I implemented all the features and maintained the servers on which the game was deployed. The game was developed using the well known Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP stack. The game attracted some 3,500 monthly active players, which made it one of the largest games of this genre in The Netherlands.

        <!-- Projects

        <h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
        <p class="first">
          Some projects I've been working on recently:
        </p>
        <h3>
          Medical education application using zSpace
          <span class="sub">Thesis project for Computing Science</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="first">
          Implemented a Virtual Reality application for medical education using the <a href="http://zspace.com" target="_blank">zSpace device</a>. Students have to assemble body parts at the correct position in 3D space. My job was to develop the application and test the application with students to see how they react to the new Virtual Reality technique. The implementation language is C++ and the graphics framework <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/" target="_blank">Open Scene Graph</a> is used.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Digital Image Correlation in Matlab
          <span class="sub">Thesis project for Applied Physics | <a href="https://github.com/joostouwerling/dic" target="_blank">Github</a></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="first">
          I implemented a digital image correlation algorithm in Matlab, which was used to approximate 3D topography for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. The algorithm boils down to an iterative optimization problem in six dimensions, as described in the report in the repository. The program takes two SEM images, in which the samples are slightly moved, and approximates the displacement of every feature in the images. 
        </p>
        <h3>
          Sport performance management in Java
          <span class="sub">Project for distributed computing | <a href="https://github.com/joostouwerling/netcomputing" target="_blank">Github</a></span>
        </h3>
        <p class="first">
          The aim of the project was to learn about distributed computing over the web. I implemented an Android application that generated heatmaps of sports players during matches, which can be viewed through a web interface. The implementation language is Java and the network techniques used were UDP sockets, RabbitMQ, Rest API's and Java Servlets.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Various hackathon projects in JavaScript
        </h3>

          <li>Built <a href="https://github.com/dhfromkorea/chimehack" target="_blank">an anonymous chat</a> at Twitter's #CHIMEHACK 2 using AngularJS and Firebase.</li>
          <li>A route planner for London's <a href="https://github.com/joostouwerling/londondata" target="_blank">Santandar bikes</a> for Programmr's London Open Data contest. Implemented using AngularJS and the API of Santander. Won the 4th prize. The project can be viewed <a href="http://joostouwerling.com/londendata/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
          <li>For Programmr's San Francisco Open Data contest I built a <a href="https://github.com/joostouwerling/sfopendata" target="_blank">park exploration webapp</a> on top of Google Maps, where people could see all parks including ratings in SF. Won the 4th prize. The project can be viewed <a href="http://www.joostouwerling.com/sfopendata/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
